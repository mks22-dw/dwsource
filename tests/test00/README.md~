This directory contains 3 files:
- mcs.txt: Multiple choice questions with answers.
- pcs.txt: Programming questions without answers.
- pas.txt: Answers to the programming questions.

The questions in the files are numbered, most importantly the numbers match in pas.txt and pcs.txt, so you can look them up.

These questions have been provided by students, and I have not verified them all, it is possible there are some mistakes.
